Dear {{var:name:""}},

 

{{var:TDSN_No:""}}- {{var:property_address:""}}

 

We are unable progress this proposal for resolution by TDS because we do not consider that the parties have done enough to try to reach an agreement first.

 

What happens next?

 

You now have until {{var:deadline_date:""}} to reach agreement or tell us what you have done to attempt an early resolution via our online portal.

 

If you reach agreement, we will instruct the deposit to be repaid within 5 working days from when we receive confirmation from both parties about the agreement.

 

If you don’t reach agreement, we will decide whether we can accept the case for adjudication. We will need to see evidence from you of the efforts you have made to resolve the dispute yourselves. Please note that, under the tenancy deposit protection legislation, we cannot accept a dispute for adjudication unless we are satisfied that you have attempted to resolve the issues first.

 

Please review the deposit allocation proposal details by:

 

Logging into your account, {{var:CTA_link:""}}
Review the ‘Deposit Summary’ page,
Select the ‘Review proposal’ option,

 

You can reduce the amount you are requesting from the deposit or tell us that repayment of the deposit is agreed.

  

Kind regards,

 

Sanam Khan

Head of Resolution Operations
